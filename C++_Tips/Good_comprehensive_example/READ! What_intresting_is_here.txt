In homework_15 files, you can find a number of programming practices:

- .cpp and .h files 
- classes and inheritance 
- virtual functions problem, see comment to void draw_lines() const; 
- find_max_value function
- good practice of saving and reading data from the file
- converting doubles to string with the required precision
- the factorial function of iteration and the recursive approaches
- switch case statement with enum type usage
- storing the objects that need to be normally initialized with a constructor (Vector_ref type)
- dealing with the objects in the class that also should have initialized constructor like Text objects – I had Text label. This is done by initializing it in a class constructor, see Bar_chart constructor.


Graphical issues
- drawing the function
- how to make a sum series function and draw it
- auto-adjusting scale for the charts (it is done at the beginning of int homework() function)
- making graphs such as histogram
- resetting the chart 


… and many more




In homework16_3 you will find a program that dispalys button which moves with image, it contains:

- rand values handling for moving a graphical object
- how to protect from gettin object away of frame
